# city-data-visualizer
I noticed recently that a lot of cities have started their own open data initiatives. I'm interested in developing some tools to visualize some of it / to see how much of it gives useful insights.

Note:
  QueryCrimeDatabase.php and MapboxAPIKey.js will need to be running in order to view a functional page
